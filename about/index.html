	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>My name is Emily Lindemer, and this site is a collection of my work, both ongoing and completed projects,
	and my general interests.</p>
	<p>My educational background comprises both computer science and neuroscience with a strong emphasis in research.
	I completed my Bachelor's of Science from McGill University in Montreal with a major in computational neuroscience and a minor in computer science.
	I then moved to Boston to work as a research assistant at the Boston VA Healthcare System in a neuroimaging
	laboratory where I learned about medical imaging -- both acquisition and post-processing -- and deepened my understanding of
	statistical methods for scientific research.</p>
	<p>I completed my PhD in the Harvard-MIT <a href="https://hst.mit.edu/Harvard-MIT"> Division of Health Sciences and Technology</a>
	and did my dissertation research in the <a href="https://www.martinos.org/lab/lcn">Laboratory for Computational Neuroimaging</a> at the <a href="https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/">Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging</a> at Massachusetts General Hospital.
	My research involved both the development of machine learning MRI image processing tools as well as the application of these tools to answer clinical questions about aging and Alzheimer's disease. These tools are hosted on my personal github site and the publications resulting from my work are listed in my CV. My final PhD dissertation can be found <a href="/pdf/DISSERTATION.pdf">here.</a> </p>
	<p>In an unexpected turn of events, I also co-founded a company during the last year of my graduate education. While still at the intersection of technology and healthcare, this company's focus is on the development and dissemination of a digital platform to help individuals in recovery for opioid addiction
  rebuild their social environments and to deliver critical, actionable information to their healthcare providers. You can learn more about it <a href="http://heycharlie.org">here.</a>
	<p>I am currently employed as a Staff Scientist at <a href="http://www.corticometrics.com">CorticoMetrics,</a> a company based off of FreeSurfer's technology that aims to bring the power of quantitative neuroimaging to the patient bedside by creating more advanced tools for radiologists and neurologists.</p>
	<p>When I'm not working or doing research, I focus my efforts on initiatives that encourage and promote women and girls in STEM fields. I spent one year as an instructor for the national <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a> organization, and the following year as the co-chair of the <a href="http://www.gwamit.org/">Graduate Women at MIT</a> organization. I am also an avid reader, yoga practioner, and outdoor travel enthusiast. My life goal is to visit every U.S. National Park, of which I have currently seen 20.
