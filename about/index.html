	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>My name is Emily Lindemer, and this site in a collection of my work, both ongoing and completed projects,
	and my general interests.</p>
	<p>My educational background straddles both computer science and neuroscience, with a strong emphasis in research.
	I completed my Bachelor's of Science from McGill University in Montreal with a major in computational neuroscience and a minor in computer science.
	During my time at McGill, I conducted research in three different laboratories whose focuses ranged from single-cell tracings in macaque cortices,
	understanding the human visual system's ability to perceive motion, and investigation of human motor control for both speech and limb motion. My undergraduate
	thesis research was published in the <a href="http://msurj.mcgill.ca/vol5/iss1/msurjvol5iss1.pdf">McGill Student Undergraduate Research Journal.</a>
	I also spent a year as a teaching assistant for Introduction to Computing which focused on the fundamentals of Java programming.</p>
	<p>After completing my undergraduate degree, I moved to Boston, MA to work as a research assistant at the Boston VA Healthcare System in a neuroimaging
	laboratory focusing on both the physical and functional affects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) on the human brain
	in a popuation of combat veterans. During this time I learned about medical imaging -- both acquisition and post-processing -- and deepened my understanding of
	statistical methods for scientific research. My two years at the VA culminated in a scientific <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3777819/">publication</a> in which I describe a novel metric for the assessment
 	of the cumulative lifetime burden of PTSD on the human brain and its relationship to brain structure.</p>
	<p>Following my work at the VA, I enrolled in the <a href="https://hst.mit.edu/Harvard-MIT"> Division of Health Sciences and Technology</a> PhD program in Medical Engineering and Medical Physics.</p>
