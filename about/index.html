	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>My name is Emily Lindemer, and this site in a collection of my work, both ongoing and completed projects,
	and my general interests.</p>
	<p>My educational background straddles both computer science and neuroscience, with a strong emphasis in research.
	I completed my Bachelor's of Science from McGill University in Montreal with a major in computational neuroscience and a minor in computer science.
	During my time at McGill, I conducted research in three different laboratories and worked as a computer science teaching assistant.</p>
	<p>After completing my undergraduate degree, I moved to Boston, MA to work as a research assistant at the Boston VA Healthcare System in a neuroimaging
	laboratory focusing on both the physical and functional affects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) on the human brain
	in a popuation of combat veterans. During this time I learned about medical imaging -- both acquisition and post-processing -- and deepened my understanding of
	statistical methods for scientific research.</p>
	<p>Following my work at the VA, I enrolled in the <a href="https://hst.mit.edu/Harvard-MIT"> Division of Health Sciences and Technology</a> PhD program in Medical Engineering and Medical Physics.
	In keeping with my interest for neuroimaging, I joined the <a href="https://www.martinos.org/lab/lcn">Laboratory for Computational Neuroimaging</a> at the <a href="https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/">Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging</a> at Massachusetts General Hospital.
	One of the primary focuses in this lab is the development of the open source neuroimaging processing software called <a href="https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/">FreeSurfer.</a> I focused on assessing and investigating subtle changes to the brain's white matter that occur in both aging and age-related disease processes such as Alzheimer's disease. This research involved both the development of machine-learning based image processing tools as well as the application of these tools to answer clinical questions. These tools are hosted on my personal github site and the publications resulting from my work are listed in my CV. My final PhD dissertation can be found here. </p>
	<p>In an unexpected turn of events, I also co-founded a company during the last year of my graduate education. While still at the intersection of technology and healthcare, this company's focus is on the development and dissemination of a digital platform to help individuals in recovery for opioid addiction
  rebuild their social environments and to deliver critical, actionable information to their healthcare providers. You can learn more about it <a href="heycharlie.org">here.</a>
	<p>I am currently employed as a Staff Scientist at <a href="www.corticometrics.com">CorticoMetrics,</a> a company based off of FreeSurfer's technology that aims to bring the power of quantitative neuroimaging to the patient bedside by creating more advanced tools for radiologists and neurologists.</p>
	<p>When I'm not working or doing research, I focus my efforts on initiatives that encourage and promote women and girls in STEM fields. I spent one year as an instructor for the national <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a> organization, and the following year as the co-chair of the <a href="http://www.gwamit.org/">Graduate Women at MIT</a> organization. I am also an avid reader, yoga practioner, and outdoor travel enthusiast. My life goal is to visit every U.S. National Park, of which I have currently seen 20.
