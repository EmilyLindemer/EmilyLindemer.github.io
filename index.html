	<h1>Emily Lindemer</h1>
	<p>I am a computer science-neuroscientist hybrid with a strong interest in entrepreneurship particularly when it's for social impact. I recently received my PhD from the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, and this site is a collection of my work and interests, both professional and for fun. <a href="/about">More about me here.</a></p>
