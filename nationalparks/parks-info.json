I may be biased because it's also the one that I've visited the most and have created a lot of memories there, but damn it's beautiful and so unique. One of my favorite things about Acadia is the immediate presence of the ocean. You can go on a hike up one of the park's interior mountains (some might not agree that these are mountains), and from the top have a 270 degree view of the Atlantic which is pretty spectacular.",
